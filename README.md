# comfyuiForUI
Some exploration of creating game UI with SD and Comfyui
Basically adapted what I learned so far about Comfyui to create a customizable workflow in order to transfer simple vectors to game ui and changing the part needed with inpainting node.
Still a lot of things can be tweaked including nodes, model selections and numbers.
So far I am using Ipadapter for style reference but Lora should provide more consistent style.
Overall I think it's a good starting point for playing around and I am looking forward to seeing what others get.
